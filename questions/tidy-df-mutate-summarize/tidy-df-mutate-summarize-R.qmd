-   Part (a) - Narrative correctly describes what the code chunk does, what the pipeline does, and comments on what the message says.

-   Part (b) - Narrative correctly describes what the code chunk does, what the pipeline does, especially mentioning what the `.groups` argument does, and comments on how the output is different from the one in part (a). 

-   Part (c) - Narrative correctly describes what each pipeline does, and how the outputs of the two pipelines are different. 

-   Code output is shown for all parts.

-   Code style and readability: Line breaks after each |>, proper indentation, spaces around = signs if they are present, and spaces after commas if they are present.
