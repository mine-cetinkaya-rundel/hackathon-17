a\. This code chunk groups by var_2 and 3. Then the mean is calculated. 

```{r}
df |>
  group_by(var_2, var_3) |>
  summarize(mean_var_1 = mean(var_1))
```

b\. This code chunk is the same as part a, but no grouping. 

```{r}
df |>
  group_by(var_2, var_3) |>
  summarize(mean_var_1 = mean(var_1), .groups = "drop")
```

c\.

The first pipeline groups by var 2 and 3 and calculates the mean with no grouping.  

The second pipeline groups by var 2 and 3 and calculates the mean. This is using mutate, which changes the dataframe. 

```{r}
df |>
  group_by(var_2, var_3) |>
  summarize(mean_var_1 = mean(var_1), .groups = "drop")

df |>
  group_by(var_2, var_3) |>
  mutate(mean_var_1 = mean(var_1))
```
